## Planning and Development Process

As I am looking to start a startup with a friend of mine, I thought why not just create a segment of what I would like the user to experience. 

Given my knowledge thus far, I am dedicating this project to creating a mockup of a freelancer’s homepage when he/she accesses the platform. It’ll (hopefully) be an ideal one-stop platform to see a summary of their jobs (past and upcoming), search for jobs, schedule and manage their profiles.

During the development, I usually focused on the functionality of each component first before moving on to the CSS. However, as the project went on, I came to understand also the importance of UX/UI such that I would want to continue honing my design skills as well to produce something in the future that is both aesthetically and functionally pleasing. 

### Problem-Solving Strategy

Every time I face an obstacle, I would usually refer to youtube or forums to clear doubts, if not I would consult peers. If I couldn't solve the issue, I would pivot and find an alternative way of producing a similar result.

### Unsolved problems

- Unique users when visiting the site
    - Review box can be edited and commented by anyone under any alias
    - Changes in appointments can be made by anyone
- Job data not as ideal, would require my own data as I collect them in the future
- Schedular component still not fully utilised (changes made there won't make changes to upcoming/past jobs)
- Many more features that I would like to add as I learn more along the way

## APIs Used

Adzuna - Wanted to find an API for freelance jobs in Singapore but this was the closest I could find. This api provided basic details needed for the job board.

Quotable - As we're big on empowerment (thus calling ourselves OWN it), a random inspirational quote could be what's needed to urge someone to hustle
